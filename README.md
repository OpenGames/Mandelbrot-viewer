# Mandelbrot-viewer
*A tool to search for a nice shapes in a Mandelbrot set*

### Some history
I and the very friend of mine [@Saxarok](https://github.com/Saxarok) were just sitting and rofling about fractals and the way to render them about a year ago.
With some nostalgic memories (and some wiki scrolling) i am, at night, come up with idea of making a tool.
Tool to search for a nice shapes in a Mandelbrot set ~you have alredy seen that~

So here ***it*** is, really unoptimized, with crappy design and so on.

But! i'm really looking into making this program fully complete

i.e. 
  - [ ] adding **more** crappy design
  - [ ] adding arbirtaty precision numbers
  - [ ] moving everythig to GPU-computation
  - [ ] maybe rendering videos to break some world-records [?]
