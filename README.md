# Mandelbrot-viewer
*A tool to search for nice shapes in the Mandelbrot set*

### Some history
I and the very friend of mine [@Saxarok](https://github.com/Saxarok) were just sitting and rofling about fractals and the way to render them about a year ago.

One night, while feeling nostalgic about those memories, I came up with an idea of a tool to search for nice shapes in the Mandelbrot set ~(as you haven't already seen that)~

So here ***it*** is, really unoptimized, with crappy design and so on...

I'm really looking forward to implementing some of those missing features:
  - [ ] **more** CrApPy design
  - [ ] arbirtaty precision numbers
  - [ ] GPU-computation mode
  - [ ] probably rendering videos to break some world-records?
